 * Concrete example component that wraps around its base component to provide

 *
 * Generally you do not want to mix in your examples with your base component because:
 *  - will add to the overall library size, esp with multiple examples
 *  - has no particular use in production
 *  - adds parsing overhead
 *
 * Essentially, keep the examples components separate from the base ones.

 * @todo Change to es6 classes when the following is resolved:
 * https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen/issues/10
